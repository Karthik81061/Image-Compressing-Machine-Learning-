# Image-Compressing-Machine-Learning-
a process applied to a graphics file to minimize its size in bytes without degrading image quality below an acceptable threshold

Use the imagein file or Use your own image make sure assign the image path and file type.(plt.imread("file path\File Name.file formate")<br>
Enter the samples after code processing it will ask to give a file name to compressed image.<br>
After code processing complete check out the compressed image in the same folder as code present.
